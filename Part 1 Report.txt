Project Part 1 Report
The data was collected from worldometers.info, specifically from the individual country pages on the website to scrape the daily and cumulative data directly from their charts. We ran our scraping code on worldometers to collect all the countries that it has as options, and then used those countries as the possible inputs for the individual country pages for the Covid death data. We also scraped the other half of the worldometers page, regarding population, to get the individual country populations and therefore normalize the death data per 1M people for each country. 
For the JSON files, there are individual JSON files for each of the possible countries from worldometers, and each country has two files, one for each of the two consecutive days that the data was scraped. JSON files have the date collected in the file name, and inside the file, it has the date followed by the total deaths, total deaths normalized, daily deaths, and daily deaths normalized all for that date. That order is then repeated for all of the dates that the data was collected for.
